# 0-installation-script

1. First, I created the directory where this SASS project will live. I was inside my alx-intermediate-frontend repo, and I typed:
   mkdir 0x03-sass_scss
   (It took me 3 tries because I kept forgetting the underscores ðŸ˜…)

2. I read that I needed to install Node.js version 20.16 on Ubuntu, so I followed the instructions from the task:
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   I had no idea what this line was doing at first, but apparently it's installing NVM (Node Version Manager). Looked scary but worked.

3. After that, I had to **close the terminal** using `exit` and open it again. I totally forgot to do this at first and couldnâ€™t understand why nothing was working. Classic rookie mistake.

4. Once the terminal was open again, I typed:
   nvm install 20.16.0
   Then ran: `node -v` to check the version. When I saw it printed `v20.16.0`, I felt like a genius (even though I had no idea what it meant yet ðŸ¤“).

5. Next, I finally tried to install SASS using npm. I typed:
   npm install sass -v 3.7.4
   This took a few tries because at first I forgot to run `npm init -y` in the project folder â€” another thing I had to Google like 7 times.

6. I had a moment of panic because I didnâ€™t see anything change in my folder. Then I realized `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` were added, which meant it worked (yay!).

7. To double-check, I ran:
   npx sass --version
   It showed me the version installed. I still wasnâ€™t totally sure what this meant, but at least there were no red error messages.

8. Honestly, as someone whoâ€™s still learning how to even type basic commands into a terminal, this whole thing took me **one full day**. I made lots of small mistakes. I didnâ€™t know what to do when errors popped up. I typed prompts wrong so many times because I donâ€™t know code yet. 

Thank God for AI tools â€” without them, I think this would have taken me at least **23 days** to figure out. Even though it was tough and confusing, Iâ€™m proud that I got SASS installed, and I now understand a little more about what these tools do. On to the next task! ðŸ’»âœ¨
